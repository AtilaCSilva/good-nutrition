      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>135g/4Â¾oz plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>Â½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>130ml/4Â½fl oz milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>
          2 tbsp melted butter (allowed to cool slightly) or olive oil, plus extra
          for cooking
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and caster sugar into a large bowl.
          In a separate bowl or jug, lightly whisk together the milk and egg, then
          whisk in the melted butter.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and, using a fork, beat
          until you have a smooth batter. Any lumps will soon disappear with a
          little mixing. Let the batter stand for a few minutes.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a knob of butter.
          When it's melted, add a ladle of batter (or two if your frying pan is
          big enough to cook two pancakes at the same time). It will seem very
          thick but this is how it should be. Wait until the top of the pancake
          begins to bubble, then turn it over and cook until both sides are golden
          brown and the pancake has risen to about 1cm/Â½in thick.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Repeat until all the batter is used up. You can keep the pancakes warm
          in a low oven, but they taste best fresh out the pan.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Serve with lashings of real maple syrup and extra butter, if you like.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Recipe Tips</h2>
        <article>
          <p>For extra-fluffy pancakes, substitute self-raising flour for plain flour and still use the baking powder. Serve the pancakes with fresh strawberries and good vanilla ice cream</p>
          <p>
            Use half buckwheat flour and half plain flour and serve with maple syrup and bacon. You can also add one teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the buckwheat batter and serve with caramelised apple slices and thick double cream.
